Portfolio Website Update

After recreating a large portion of the website for my portfolio:

Updated my portfolio to include my project 1 and one homework assignment

Updated my github and pinned repo's

Updated my resume to fit the criteria

Updated my Linkedin

Recreated website has links to github repo as well as deployed page for the 2 projects i listed on it.

followed all expectations for page layout as far as i can tell and featured title(via image) links to correct page and repo via button. and screenshot is listed below my buttons!

Page is mostly web responsive but havent gotten my pictures to work below a very small threshhold on page.

Used a similar color pallete to the one i chose for our project 1(brown and greys are easy on the eyes)
