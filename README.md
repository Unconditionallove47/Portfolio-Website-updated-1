# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

**Created a portfolio from scratch as requested, instead of listing images that point to specific work i used them as placeholders. I have some available work via my links in the footer that take you to github and my hackster as well as my linkedin.

**My media screen seems to function almsot perfectly besides the ain work piece not functioning correctly for about 10% on downsize but resizes correctly.

** I attemped to put a solid line vertically as instructed but was never able to actually see the line(although i recieved no errors.)

**For my about me section across from my name, i used dummy #'s so they dont actually link to anything since i dont have any projects connected via the images.

**I was able to correctly link my works on screen to have hover effects but multiple tries for the images never produced any results.

**I attmeped to flex everything properly and think i achieved that for the most part!
